# Project Design
I designed the project during my time at Nucamp's Back-End & DevOps bootcamp. I came up with the idea of users post projects and join/work together to build projects of their own together. This came up to me when I wanted to start a project but it was too much to handle on my own and wished there was a partner I can do it with and build techincal skills together along with building teamwork. 

# Database Implementation
Prior to implementing PostgreSQL, I designed a ER Diagram that best relates to the project. One-one, One-to-many, Many-to-Many relationships were created during the database design. ORM syntax approach was used to enahnce conveniency and consistency.
